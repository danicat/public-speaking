# Danicat's Public Speaking Resources

Hi! I'm Daniela Petruzalek and this is my public speaking resources repository. Here you will find information about my past, present and future talks. If you are interested in having me speaking at your conference, see the instructions below.

## Inviting me to speak at your conference

My main areas of interest are cloud computing (Google Cloud), back end development, Go, Python, data engineering, recommender systems and game development, although almost everything technology-related is fair game for me (except java! :)

I can also speak about career, leadership and personal development.

If you want me to speak at your conference please raise a Request for Speaker issue on this repository or send your invitation to daniela.petruzalek@gmail.com. Please make sure to include event name, website, date, location and if you cover travel expenses or not (if outside London, UK).

It is also good to have an idea of what kind of presentation you have in mind. If you want an original talk, you may want to have a look at the [past events](#past-events) session below to have an idea of what kind of talks I did before.
